Interval-Runner

This android app helps in running intervals (HIIT). Project is not finished yet.

Set interval length and number of intervals (iterations) in settings screen. Then start your workout! When iteration hits 0:00 sound is played-time to change pace.

I came up with an idea for this app because I need it :) I am a huge fan of HIIT. My goal is to create an app which lets you create your own workout. Run-phase and rest-phase times should be customizable (i.e. one iteration consists of 25 seconds run and 60 seconds rest). User can save,edit and remove workouts. Training (if user prefers to) will be drown on a map and ran distance is calculated in real time. User has his own account and his workout history, plans and goals are saved on a remote server.

Well, that's the idea. I am not very experienced Android developer (yet) and I am not sure how far will I make it :)
